<!--Lesson 6: The HTML Structure(the proper one ) :
Which gives us access to all the feature of HTML. This sturcute is : html element ,
head element and the body element .This structure we have to have in every HTML file . 
When we do not have the sctucture like this : atehere when we click insert the webpage
does it for us and  it's actually best to have this structure in our code 
because we're actually missing some useful features. 
So we go to the firs codes we wrote (pra Lesson1) and we write this proper structure  -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This is not really an element, it's just a special line that has 
a meaning to the browser.This tells a browser to use a modern version of html.
?What is the difference though btw old and new version of HTML?
If we don't have this, it sort of falls back to an older version that has less features.-->
<html>
  <head>
    <!--Lesson 1-->
<p>paragraph of text</p>
<button>Hello 1</button>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">Link to YouTube</a> 
  </head> 

  <body>
    <title>Advencing </title> <!--Eshte the name of the web page.Kur nuk e bejme kete kod atehere
    the name of the webpage is by defolt the name of the HTML file where we are coding the webpage
    we have (pra ne kete rast :L6). Also kete kod po e shkrujtem jo ne booton element ose ne head
    element  prap funksionon sikurse funksiononte kur nuk e futim the code in head element me the 
    code of webpage . 
    ?Akoma nuk e di se cilat jane the code that are not accesesable without using
    the head and button element.?-->
<!--Every time we write a new code we have to make it save in the HTML file and refresh the webpage 
in order to see the code in the webpage. Now if first we insole the life server (a VS code extension)
in the Extensions button atehere duke cilick anywhere in this file and choose "open with life server" 
atehere after we write this code and save it it imediately shows into the webpage so there is no need 
refresh.
Now the live server doest  work if there isn't the proper HTML sctucture.    -->
  </body>
</html> <!--it is an elemnt that says there is a website inside it.We have to have
put this <html> in the top of every HTML file and the </html>(which is called the closing
tag)in the end of every HTML -->
<!--nesting - an element inside an element just like in lesson 5 and in here above -->
<!--We can only have one and only  html element in one HTML file(1 HTML file = 1 webpage ) .
And this element  represents the entire webpage.And inside this html elemnt can only have one head element 
and one body element and then everything on our webpage(all the html code that we write) 
is supposed to go either inside the head or inside the body element . 
So both the head and body element  are also designed for nesting or to have elements 
inside. 
The body element contain all the elements that are visible on the page. So basically all that we
 have coded until now.So the code in Lesson 1 is in btw <head ></head>. So we put it there.
 At the <button></button> we write everything that is not part of the webpage:See the photo in 
 Word: Lesson 6 .
 the bookmark bar , the html bar and the window that shows the name of the webpage 
 Remember all of this are HTML code not CSS code . 
Also in the html element we put all the code of the style  pra the CSS cause the CSS changes the style
of the element not create a new element.
